# NEXT STEPS
# TODO: Be able to chat with trainer agent, before moving to nutritionist, not just single verification.

# - Better output from Trainer into nutritionist, also nutritionist doesn't know shit about the user when called.
# - Nutritionist is outputing meals, it shouldn't, output only macros.
# - Nutritionist should have access to available meals csv + nutrition details.

# - Final agent that presents this into a table or markdown file, that can be imported into notion.

# Next steps
# - How to chat, and iterate with a specific one?
# - Is it more useful than previous one?
# - How better it get's with o1 mini or o1 preview?
# - should have a training lead / manager? that oversees to each agent? hierarchy?
# - Jeff nippard agent? ðŸ‘€ Jeremy either agent? would be fun


# - Longevity agents?
# - DNA access, bloodwork access, and aging pace scores :/
